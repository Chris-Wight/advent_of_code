# Advent of Code - Day Two challenge - Personal reflection
Part two was a bit frustrating at first, as i was trying to resolve the issue by solving all of the problems related to the conditions that needed to be met. This resulted in multiple if statements, turnery's, recursive functions and loops. While i did get this to work in the end, the code was not legible, and i felt that a brute force method would be better, even though it was not particularly performance efficient when we account for large arrays.

I think code wise that a better approach would be needed for use in a real world scenario where large data lists are used, however for the challenge this was the best and cleanest approach i could do without nested if statements and recursive functions.
